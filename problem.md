Assignment
Technical Assessment: MP3 File Analysis App

Objective

The aim of this task is to create an API endpoint according to the specification below that accepts an MP3 file and responds with the number of frames in the file. A sample file is provided for candidates to test their solution against.

This assessment will test the candidate's ability to:

    Learn & apply new knowledge in a likely unfamiliar context

    Demonstrate technical competency in Typescript

    Show personal coding styles & preferences


API Specification

    The application must host an endpoint at /file-upload that accepts an MP3 file upload via the POST method.

    The endpoint must successfully count the number of frames for MPEG Version 1 Audio Layer 3 files (This is almost universally the format for .mp3 files, including the provided sample).

    The endpoint must provide a JSON response (with the correct response headers) in the following format:

⚠️ Handling of other MPEG file formats should be considered out of scope for this exercise & candidates are encouraged not to spend time on this.

    The endpoint must provide a JSON response (with the correct response headers) in the following format:

{
"frameCount": <number>
}

Note: <number> should be the correct number of frames in the MP3 file


Requirements

The candidate:

    Must use TypeScript to complete the exercise.

    Must parse the MP3 file to logically count the number of frames in the file.

    Must not use an NPM package to parse the MP3 frame data directly. NPM packages may be used for other things such as generic utilities or a http framework.

    Must respond to the client with the correct number of frames found in the file, in the format specified above.


Evaluation Criteria

The candidate's solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness

    Does the solution meet the requirements?

    Does the solution correctly determine the number of frames in the MP3 file correctly?

    Does the solution handle errors appropriately?

Code Quality

    Is the code well-organised, readable, and maintainable?

    Does the code follow TypeScript good practices?

    Does the code utilise TypeScript's features effectively?

    Does the solution include standardised tooling for formatting, linting, testing etc?

Error Handling

    Is error handling implemented appropriately?

    Does the solution handle errors gracefully?

    Does the solution provide useful error messages to the user?

Scalability

    Is the solution scalable and able to handle large files?

    Is the solution optimised for performance?

Approach

    Has the candidate used Git effectively?

    Is there evidence of a structured approach to the solution?


Tips

    The candidate may wish to use a tool such as mediainfo to verify their results.

    Candidates are reminded to test final solutions before submission.

    Priority should be given to producing a working solution in the allotted time - Done is better than perfect. Brief comments may be left to explain optimisations / improvements that would be implemented with more time & there will be an opportunity to expand on this at interview.

    Candidates may use AI assistance to complete the exercise but the submission will still be taken as the candidates own work and therefore it should be representative of something they would write themselves and they will be expected to understand and explain the solution.
